# ParallelComputing-TextBigramsAndTrigrams
Compute n-grams on txt file in sequential and parallel version.


Compute and estimate occurrences of bigrams and trigrams in two different implementations: sequential and parallel. 
We study the different implementations through computational time and speed up, vary depending on number of threads in the parallel version. 
The chosen languages is Java for the sequential version and the java thread for the parallel version. 
The tests were performed on intel i5 dual core and the results show how the parallel version nearly halves the sequential times.
